## Personal Projects and Assignments

### [Shift Game](https://github.com/AdamM-1021/Shift-game)

Basic template for a unity platformer game.

Physics engine and movement has been implemented, as well as a tutorial level.

No extended levels as of right now, may build on it in the future or put on a game hosting site.


### [Circuit Tracer](https://github.com/AdamM-1021/Circuit-Tracer)

Brute force recursive pathfinding algorithm, written for CS 221.

Project was written in Java, and contains UI elements.


### [Format Check/ Grid Monitor](https://github.com/AdamM-1021/Format-Checker)

Format checker checks the validity of 2D array files before input.

Grid monitor takes these and runs a series of tests regarding averaging
adjacent tiles, and returns the array's properties.


### [Linked List Testers](https://github.com/AdamM-1021/List-Testers)

Java classes for single and double linked lists, with included node
class. Also contains multiple unit tests for each list.


## Smaller Classes

-------------------

### [Recursive Sort](https://github.com/AdamM-1021/Recursive-Sort)

Basic implementation of the recursive merge sort algorithm for java.

Also includes indexed unsorted and double linked lists for testing.


### [Max Heap](https://github.com/AdamM-1021/Generic_MaxHeap)

Generic type Max Heap class for java, contains the used implemented interface.

Contains all relevant functions, including the recursive heapsort and build
max heap algorithms.
